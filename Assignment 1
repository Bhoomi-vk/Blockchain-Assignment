1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?

     Blockchain can be described as a datastructure that holds transactional records and while ensuring security, transparency, and decentralization. It is a mix technology of distributed database and cryptography where information is verifiable, unchangeable, tamper-proof and immutable.A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is completely open to any and everyone on the network.Once an information is stored on a blockchain, it is extremely difficult to change or alter it.

2. What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?
   a. Data Security
   b. Decentralization

3. What are the few features which blockchain will give you?
   a. immutability and tamper detection 
   b. data protection
   c. distributed ledger technology
   d. enhanced security
   e. verifiability
   f. unchangeable

4. What all things does a Blockchain contain?
   a. block number 
   b. transaction record
   c. mining key
   d. previous block signature

5. How is the verifiability of blockchain is attained?

      The verifiability of blockchain can be attained using current fingerprint of a block which is the combination of previous fingerprint and data.
current fingerprint = previous fingerprint + data
